- This soln considers only 4 directions, horizontally and vertically
- Almost coded myself with few hiccups
- SC: visited grid and queue = O(N^2)
- TC: O(N^2)
- One optimisation that can be done is use grid itself instead of visited grid. See soln here: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_697ce91fa2988191a6015faf24aea694
