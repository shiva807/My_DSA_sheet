Mistakes:
- Was correct about the heap and hashmap soln but didn't take the key and value for hashmap properly, the count should be the key not the element
- Heap soln TC: O(N log k)
Learnings:
- Bucket sort is a new algo, more optimal for this.
- TC: O(N), SC: O(N)

Heap Soln:

from collections import Counter
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        freq = Counter(nums)
        heap = []

        for num, count in freq.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (count, num))
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)

        return [num for count, num in heap]
